## PART 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
My inspirations come from a Promotional Video for the game *Zenless Zone Zerod*.The game isn't even official issued yet, but when it's first Promotional Video was posted, I was very attracted by some of the images in it. So I think some of the imaging techniques used in it that I can learn. 

According to the assignment requirements, I would like to use layered geometric patterns in the final project, and this case has the layered appearance. It also used a fading effect so that the overall image looks smooth and does not seem stiff.
